## Why this Repo 
Here I store all my "Hello World's", design patterns implementation and any other prototyping project. 
May be useful for someone. (But probably not)

[!IMPORTANT] 
If you are a recruiter, please, do not take how I code in this repo as parameters for my coding skills. 
It is for me like when you go out on your pj's and don't expect to come across a coworker.
